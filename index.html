                    <P style="color:cornsilk"> My name is Tristan Lake, I'm from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and here are some of my hobbies</P>
                    <h4 style="color:cornsilk">Hockey</h4>
                    <P style="color:cornsilk"> My first hobby that I am going to discuss is hockey. I played hockey all throughout my life, starting way back when I was four! I played hockey all the way through high school. I used to play in Pierre, South Dakota for the Oahe Capitals before I moved to Sioux Falls in the 8th grade. from the 8th grade to my senior year, I played for the Sioux Falls Flyers. I played most of my career as a center. Although I don't play competitvley anymore, I still enjoy the game a lot, and enjoy watching the NHL. I hope to be able to join a rec league in the future so I can continue to play. My next hobby is collecting traveling.
                    <h4 style="color:cornsilk">Traveling</h4>
                    <P style="color:cornsilk">I have always enjoyed traveling, and taking vacations to new places I have never been to before. I am a big fan of moountain ranges, so at the start of summer of 2024, me and a group of my friends went on a vacation to Wyoming. I really enjoyed Wyoming's beautiful scenery, and how serene the enviroment was.</P>
